 *  Madthreading (Mad prefix is not an acronym, it is simply a shortened version
 * of my name) is a general multithreading API that is backwards compatible with
 * C++98 using pthreads -- support for Windows will likely not be written by me.
 *
 * Madthreading is a work-stealing model with low overhead. A set of threads are
 * placed in a pool and woken when tasks are passed onto the stack.
 *
 * Madthreading is an excellent option to quickly add multithreading to an
 * existing project, especially those who do not require compilation with C++11
 * support.
 *
 * The primary benefit of using Madthreading is the creation of a
 * thread-pool. Threads are put to sleep when not doing work and do not require
 * compute cycles when not in use.
 *
 * The thread-pool is created during the instantiation of the
 * thread-manager. Once the thread-manager has been created, you simply add
 * pass functions with or without arguments to the thread-manager, which
 * creates tasks and these tasks are iterated over until the task stack is
 * empty.
 *
 * Passing tasks to thread-manager is done through three primary interfaces:
 *
 * \code
 * mad::thread_manager::exec(...)       // pass one task to the stack
 * mad::thread_manager::run(...)        // similar to exec but N times
 *                                      // where N = mad::thread_manager::size()
 * mad::thread_manager::run_loop(...)   // generic construct
 * \endcode
 *
 * Tasks are not explicitly created. Instead, you pass function pointers and
 * arguments, where the arguments are for the function (exec, run) or for the
 * loop that creates the tasks (run_loop). Examples are provided in the
 * examples/ directory of the source code
 *
 * Currently, there is support for functions using 3 arguments. If you compile
 * your code with C++11 enabled, additional arguments can easily handled
 * through the use of lambdas or the STL bind:
 *
 * \code
 * // Number of threads = 4 (default) or what environment variable
 * // FORCE_NUM_THREADS is set to
 * mad::thread_manager* tm
 *      = new mad::thread_manager(mad::thread_manager::GetNumThreads(4));
 *
 * using namespace std::placeholders;
 *
 * auto arg4 = 2;
 * auto arg5 = 4.5;
 * auto arg6 = -1;
 *
 * auto func1 = [arg4, arg5, arg6] (int arg1, double arg2, long arg3)
 * {
 *      full_func(arg1, arg2, arg3, arg4, arg5, arg6);
 * };
 *
 * auto func2 = std::bind(full_func, _1, _2, _3, arg4, arg5, arg6);
 *
 * tm->exec<void>(func1, 1, 1.3, 5L);
 * tm->exec<void>(func2, 3, 4.1, 7L);
 *
 * tm->join();
 *
 * \endcode
 * At some point in the future, when Madthreading is compiled with C++11,
 * I will use template forwarding to handle any amount of function parameters
 * but for the time being, simply use this easy workaround.
 *
 * Madthreading provides a generic interface to using atomics and, when C++11 is
 * not available, provides a mutexed-based interface that works like an atomic.
 *
 * Several containers (array, deque, map, vector) using atomics as their data
 * type are available in the package. The usage of these are not guaranteed to
 * be thread-safe when resizing, etc.
 *
 * There are two forms of tasks: standard and a tree type design. The tree
 * type design is intended to be closer to the TBB design.
